Question 

   In your kernel implementation, how many threads can be simultaneously
   scheduled for execution on a GeForce GTX 280 GPU, which contains 30
   streaming multiprocessors? Use nvcc --ptxas-options="-v" matrixmul_kernel.cu 
   to see the resource usage of your kernel (although compilation will fail,
   it will only do so after compiling the kernel and displaying the relevant
   information.)


Solution
      
   According Wikipedia, I found compute capability of GeForce GTX 280 is 1.3, number of 
   resident thread per multiprocessor is 1024. Since it contains 30 streaming 
   multiprocessors, we can obtain the munber of threads which can be simultaneously 
   scheduled for execution is 1024*30 = 30720.


   To check my kernel usage, I input the following instrument and get the output:

   [luxx0201@ece-biel mp3-tiled-matrixmul]$ nvcc --ptxas-options="-v" matrixmul_kernel.cu
