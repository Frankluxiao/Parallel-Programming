1. How many times does your thread block synchronize to reduce its portion of an array to a single value?

For 512 elements, we have 

       Step 1  256 synchronize
       Step 2  128 synchronize  
       Step 3  64   synchronize  
       Step 4  32   synchronize  
       Step 5  16   synchronize  
       Step 6  8     synchronize  
       Step 7  4     synchronize  
       Step 8  2     synchronize  
       Step 9  1

Thus, the total time of synchronization is 8.

2. What is the minimum, maximum, and average number of "real" operations that a thread will perform? "Real" operations are those that directly contribute to the final reduction value.


The minimum number of “real” operations is 1;
The maximum number of “real” operations is 9;
The average number of “real” operations is (256+128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1)/256=1.9961.
