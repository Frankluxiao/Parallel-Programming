   1. What is the memory-access to floating-point computation ratio in each
      thread? Ignore the storing of the result. Only global memory loads should 
      be counted towards your off-chip bandwidth.

      The memory-access to floating-point computation ratio in each thread is 2.     
      Since the number of memory accesses for per thread is 2, one is for Vector A, 
      another one is for Vector B, thus the total number of memory accesses is 
      2*VSIZE, where VSIZE is the size of vector. For floating-point computation 
      in each thread is 1, thus the total number of computation is 1*VSIZE. 
      Therefore, we get the above conclusion.
